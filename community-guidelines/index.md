## Code of Conduct

- This Code of Conduct presents a summary of the shared values and “common sense” thinking in our community. The basic social ingredients that hold us together include:
- Be friendly, patient, and empathetic. (For experts, remember you were once newbies too)
- Be respectful towards everyone in the community. Conflicts/differences shouldn’t result in bad behaviour or personal attacks.
- Be inclusive, and careful about the words you choose.
- Be pragmatic, and collaborative.
- Support others in the community.
- Get support from others in the community, keep the discussion to the group if possible. It might help others in future.
- Don't spam.
- Links to pirated software, hacks, illegal ebooks and what not are not allowed

## Posting Guidelines

The decision on approving posts on the community is done on post to post basis, however:

The following post types are generally approved, and encouraged:

- Asking for help (guidance, programming help, opinions, etc) from other members.
- Relevant links, resources, or videos.
- Relevant news, tech events, hackathons, market trends etc.
- Job postings or other relevant professional opportunities.
- Relevant memes.

The following post types are generally not approved:

- Repeated content: Make sure to search the group and check [F.A.Q]({{site.url}}/FAQs) before asking a question. (e.g: BC(CS) vs Software engineering?)
- Posts with missing context, poorly composed posts, or vague need for help. (e.g: Need a react developer, any one working with php?). If you need good responses, you need to write good posts.
- Asking people to do your academic assignments.
- Sharing pirated content.
- Self promotion: As much as we want to see you become successful in your professional endeavours, self promotions end up spamming our members' feed so they are discouraged. We’ve plans of providing a centralised place for members to promote their skills and services they offer.

### What does a good post look like

Make sure you have all the context and information for the target audience, for example:

- Job posts: Required skills, experience, location and possibly a link to the company.
- Programming help: Some background about the issue, screenshot/pastebin link to the code, and what is the expected behaviour.
- Personalized guidance: Your background, and proper explanation about the need for guidance.
- Software development: Questions about software development are appreciated and encouraged.
