# An Introduction
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect), "A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and tries to enforce technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms." Any person with designation of Architect is responsible for the long-term planning and decisions which will improve the software application in some way.

# Technologies

Though an Architect generally does not code **features** but she should be hands on with development in order to understand and lead by example. Enterprise Architect is generally an exception as they work in very high level solutioning and integration of multiple systems. Architects use below technologies to share their vision with greater audience.
