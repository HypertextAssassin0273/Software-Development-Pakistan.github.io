# EM
Engineering Manager is a technical person who overlooks the aspects of project and team from the lense of various stakeholders. According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job-Descriptions/Engineering-Manager.htm): "They are responsible for solving any engineering issue that comes up in a project. A few of the main duties of an engineering manager are answering technical questions, proposing budgets for projects, training new employees, and working with various other departments."

# Please Read First

EM is a well known role but is only applicable in organisations where number of teams or engineers are more than 2 pizza teams and working in products. This particular role doesn't make much sense for project based work or services organisation where the priority is to ship the project rather than improve the process or engineering aspect of it.

EM leads to the role of **Director of Engineering** at larger scale.
