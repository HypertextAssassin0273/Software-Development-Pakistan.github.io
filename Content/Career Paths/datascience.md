# Data Science 

Data Science is a HUGE field, and it has been called one of the most highest paying jobs for the coming years. It's a long journey, but here's a way to get started with it!

***NOTE:*** This guide is meant to present `Data Science` as a full stack field, not limited to just building models, but rather exploring the market possibilities and the tools that fortune 500 companies to small scale companies use for to make business related decisions for the `agile` moto of `quick to market`. Take this guide to not only getting good at making models for data, but rather diving deep into how you think about handling data in anycase, and in the different ways you can easily incorporate data science to make some easy predictions!

## An Introduction

Data Science refers to the statistical analysis of the data for patterns and trends to make business decisions and to teach computers to recognize that data to give definitive answers. It's a huge field which can be used to answer questions or interesting ideas like, 

1. How do I teach a computer to recognize an image?
2. How can I train a computer bot to talk like a human?
3. How can I train a computer to accurately distinguish between two datasets?

Of course it's not immediately visible about how we can do all this, but what we can is break this huge field in several components and see how they all help.

- Machine Learning, a field basically meant to provide statistical insights into building statistical models that can provide some accuracy to answer questions such as providing a prediction of some value ( regression ) or classifying data into `yes` or `no` ( classification ).
- Deep Learning, popularized because of Neural Networks, a way to identify and extract features from a given data, and allowing that to more accurately provide insights into problems of Speech ( Recurrent Neural Networks, NLP ), or Images ( OCR, Convoluational Neural Networks ).
- Data Analysis, a kind of sub field in Data Science to provide visual understanding of the data at hand and to show the trends in data
- Data Engineering, a way to develop data pipelines, maintaing proper data sets and schemas, and to understanding who has acces to what data and how. Responsible for keeping check for the out flow and in flow of data, and for providing insights into the data streaming in and out
- Artifical Intelligence, the grass root that motivated **Data Science** to move away it from **Statistics And Probability** into a complete field of its own. It's a way of thinking that presents the main theoratical models that has inspired the idea of teching computers to think and act like humans.

## Technologies

There are a lot of technologies for each and every sub field of data science, `language` wise, you can use,

- SQL
- R
- Python

To extract patterns and the required data.
Libraries? R has a ton of them for statistical measures. Python has them, too. Some common ones from Python are.

- Tensorflow
- ScikitLearn
