## General guidelines.

Contributions are heavily appreciated. It's the community that makes the group the truly spirited and unique group that it is.

1. Go ahead and make some edit in a file where you think something additional can be added.
2. Make that into a Pull Request so that the maintainers can review and approve or reject accordingly.
3. Want to start a discussion about something that is missing? Make an issue! If the idea is helpful to everyone, we'll consider adding it into the main master repository.
4. Each section has its own contribute template that needs to be followed. So if you would like to add a field under `Learning Resources`, `Career Paths`, then go ahead the copy the format from their `README.md` and you can start writing
5. The MISC folder in `Learning Resouces` is for very niche topics, not exactly whole fields.

## FAQ

_Q:_ What's the difference between `Career Paths` and `Learning Resources`?
_A:_ Just that `Learning Resources` is supposed to have quick references and links to other places for information and learning, and `Career Paths` is supposed to serve as a guide for something completely new to break into the field.
