# Contributing Guidelines

Basic contributing guidelines include all the previous guidelines from the official [Facebook page](https://web.facebook.com/groups/softdevpk/), which include,

1. Be kind and courteous
We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.

2. No hate speech or bullying
Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading comments about things such as race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

3. No promotions or spam
Give more to this group than you take. Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed.

4. Respect everyone's privacy
Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What's shared in the group should stay in the group.
