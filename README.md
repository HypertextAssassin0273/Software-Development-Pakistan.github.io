# Software Development Pakistan

Welcome to the official repository for software development Pakistan.

The content home is hosted [here](https://github.com/Software-Development-Pakistan/Software-Development-Pakistan.github.io/blob/master/index.md).

## Working with the site locally.

You can run the site locally to see how your changes would look like. The site uses Jekyll as a static site generator, which can be installed following the instructions from [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you get jekyll to install, you can build and serve locally.

1. Clone the repository.
2. On the root folder of repository, build: `bundle exec jekyll build`.
3. Serve: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
